Ising Model:
    
 The Ising model is a simple model for ferromagnetism in statistical and has been important
to our understanding of magnetic concepts and the magnetic properties of materials. In this
investigation we will look to at the properties of a model ferromagnet. While, in general, 
we could consider any shape lattice in any dimension.This investigation will
focus on the Ising model for a 2D sqare lattice in the absense of an external magnetic
field.

The Ising model consits of a lattice of spins, that can be in one of two collinear states (+1 or -1).
In this investigation we will consider lattices with periodic boundary such that a single site
will always have 4 nearest neighbours, this can be visualised as a 3 dimensional torus and is often
refered to as such.

The hamiltonian is simply the sum of pair wise interactions between nearest neighbour spins multiplied
the interaction constant between neighbouring pairs (J). We will employ a metropolis and monte carlo algorithms
to asses the evolvution of an initally randomly or perfectly aligned lattice to a state at thermal equilibrium.

From the lattice hamiltonian and magnetization (ie. net lattice spin) a number of lattice properties can be 
extracted demonstrating a second order phase transition in such thermodynamic systems.
